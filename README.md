# Building AI Chatbots in .NET Core: A Developer’s Practical Guide
### A collaborative effort between a human developer and artificial intelligence systems, including _[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt)_, and _[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)_. Combining human expertise with AI-assisted research, content generation, and technical synthesis to craft a guide that is both technically rigorous and accessible. Beyond the technical content, hoping this repository along with the book _Building AI Chatbots in .NET Core: A Developer’s Practical Guide_ will stand as a testament to the future of human-AI collaboration.
